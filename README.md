# Codename: Modern Combat

This repository contains the source code for **Codename: Modern Combat**, a mod for the free game [Clonk Rage](http://clonk.de/cr.php).
It is archived here for future players to discover and explore the entire development history.

## Overview

The mod introduces a Battlefield-esque weapon, equipment and vehicle lineup enabling strategic, fast-paced and action-packed play across multiple different play modes.
It features dozens of highly detailed levels ("scenarios") and has received extensive playtesting and balancing, resulting in a highly competitive 2D shooter with light platforming.

At it's peak around 2010 it was played regularly by hundreds of players from the Clonk community and received regularly updates throughout 2017.
Unfortunately the playerbase dimished alongside with Clonk Rage, and online play is extremely limited as of 2019, and official development is halted.

## Development

The source code in this repository contains the entire development history, imported from the legacy version control systems.
The commit history has been slightly cleaned so that the code can easily be accessed and studied far into the future.
