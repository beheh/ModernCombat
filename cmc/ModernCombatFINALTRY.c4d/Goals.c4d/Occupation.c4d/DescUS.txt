The goal ist to capture flag posts to secure more respawn positions for the team as well as to extend its influence. Every team owns a certain number of tickets, which equal respawns.

A team is eliminated when all tickets are lost. A team looses tickets for every dead team member as well as enemy teams which occupy more flag posts and therefore reduce the own ticket count over time.

A team can be defeated prematurely by eliminating all of their team members and neutralizing all their flag posts.
